# Push_swap_42
This project will make us sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed weâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

## Introduction
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. We have at our disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.</br>
Our goal ? Write 2 programs in C:
- The first, named checker which takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard output. Once read, checker executes them and displays OK if integers are sorted. Otherwise, it will display KO.
- The second one called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard
output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.
